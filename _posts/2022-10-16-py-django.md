**Thursday Evening Update**
- Recording about Django forms from this afternoon is [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/84yC965VYsvj7ioW486UzprXgMSqcwtmdoFG996Q2dpZ6lfDWdtoyr1RzUaHjURi.iGXI721KADZTaHJw?startTime=1666293968000%20Passcode:%20Q%XqL?Z9).
The code from the above video is [here](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-15/django-music-rlconley).  
- For Django Music, there are parts we didn‚Äôt talk directly about, but they are similar to parts we did and also similar to DjangoGirls.  
   - The mechanism for how delete and edit pinpoint a single Album instance is similar to how the detail page does it.  
   - The form for edit is very similar to the form for create.  
   - Delete does not require a form.  
- There will be optional office hours tomorrow (Friday) at 2:00pm in the classroom.
- The form to indicate people you‚Äôd especially like to pair with next week on a Django project is [here](https://forms.gle/8sqoJZRE9YNP4S9a7). Please complete it by noon tomorrow (Friday).



### For the üêª Track, the week will look like this:
The notes and resources are the same as for ü¶ä track,
but the assignment is different. Freeshelf involves 
creating a digital library. It engages the same concepts
as Django music with some additional concepts you may find interesting and useful if you are comfortable with the material in DjangoGirls. You will work in breakout rooms with other track members. Mon-Thurs 11:30am - 12pm and 3:30pm - 4pm in the classroom will be reserved for üêª track to get help from the instructor. To get asynchronous feedback on code, @Rebecca in the class slack channel and drop your GitHub link.

üéØ Assignment Due Monday:
