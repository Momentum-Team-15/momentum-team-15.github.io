### For the 🐻 Track, the week will look like this:
The notes and resources are the same as for 🦊 track,
but the assignment is different. Freeshelf involves 
creating a digital library. It engages the same concepts
as Django music with some additional concepts you may find interesting and useful if you are comfortable with the material in DjangoGirls. You will work in breakout rooms with other track members. Mon-Thurs 11:30am - 12pm and 3:30pm - 4pm in the classroom will be reserved for 🐻 track to get help from the instructor. To get asynchronous feedback on code, @Rebecca in the class slack channel and drop your GitHub link.

🎯 Assignment Due Monday:
Django Freeshelf
