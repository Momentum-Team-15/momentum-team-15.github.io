- This week, you will choose between two different "tracks," Fox and Bear, which will each have their own approach to the material and different assignments.
  
## This Week: Choose a Track ü¶ä Fox (more live code with the instructor, more time together in the classroom, assignments meant to solidify key concepts) or üêª Bear (more time in breakout rooms, asynchronous feedback on code, intentionally complex assignments).

### For the ü¶ä Track, the week will look like this:
**Monday**
1. Review and reinforce fundamental Python concepts by live coding Mystery Word together and answering any questions students have. 
  - Values and Variables  
  - Input and Output  
  - Strings & String Formatting  
  - While Loops  
  - Conditionals  
  - Lists & Tuples  
  - For Loops
