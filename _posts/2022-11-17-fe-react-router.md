## 🎯 Project

You should have detailed wireframes and a user flow outline, and components for at least the initial "page" your user is going to see when they arrive at your site. By today, you should be able to make GET requests for questions and their answers (if you are working on Questionbox) or for cards and friends (if you are working on Social E-Cards).

🚀 You should deploy to Netlify today if you haven't already.

## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

⚠️ These two resources are for **older versions of React Router**, so you will see some **outdated syntax**. For instance `Switch`, `Redirect`, and the `component` prop on `Route` exist only in versions of React Router earlier than version 6. However, the main concepts are the same, so these resources can still help you understand the context and usage of React Router.
