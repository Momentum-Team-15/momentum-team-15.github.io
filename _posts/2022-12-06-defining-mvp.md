## ‚úÖ TODO today

### 1. üëâ What is your app and what does it do?

Your first and most important goal today is to **clearly define your team's Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.

One representative on behalf of your team should [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/e8khJyQRnoA6Lr5BA) **by the end of today** to tell us what product you want to build. We only need one response for the whole team, so please make sure the responses represent everyone on your team.

### 2. Post your team charter in your team's Slack channel

Please pin or bookmark it at the top of the channel so that it can be referenced easily.

## üõπ Defining MVP and prioritizing features

Use these slides to guide your team discussions today. We'll go over them together when we meet, followed by time to work on creating your product roadmap with your team.

### User Personas

You don't necessarily need to create user personas for your app, but you do need to determine and explicitly define who your users are.

### User Stories

You _do_ need to write user stories. You'll be ready to do this once you can answer the question "What is your app and what does it do?"
