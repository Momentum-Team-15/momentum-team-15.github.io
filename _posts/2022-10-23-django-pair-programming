title: Pair Programming With Django
tags: phase-2 python django
---

- This week, we will be working from Monday to Thursday at noon in groups of 2 and 3 on a building a Django application using a common
practice from software development called Pair Programming. 
- Thursday afternoon there will be no class session, so that you can prepare your End of Phase Presentations, due Friday at noon.

## Teams
- Team Guitar ðŸŽ¸: Corey, Taylor, Cameron P.
- Team Accordion ðŸª—:  Webster, Angelo, Hatice
- Team Saxophone ðŸŽ·: Ray, Scottie, Chris
- Team CongaðŸª˜: Aaron, Marcus, Cameron G.
- Team Violin ðŸŽ»: Jon, Andrew, Eli
- Team Keys ðŸŽ¹: Issam, Jacob, Tim
- Team Banjo ðŸª•: Nicholas, Lucian	

## Pair (or 3) Programming
- We will be following this [Pair Programming Session Template](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/template). Please read the linked article before proceeding with the assignment. The main steps described in detail in the article are:

  1. Agree on the high-level goal out loud.
  2. Break the work into a handful of tasks and prioritize them.
  3. Decide your driver/navigator swapping strategy. Please keep the time that each person is "driving" (typing) as equal as possible within the group. Perhaps set a timer to determine when to switch. 
  4. Configure git to share credit.
  5. Eliminate distractions. 
     - (This looks different for different people. Example: maybe you need to stand up or incorporate a fidget device. If it works for everyone on the team, incorporating background brown noise or low-fi music is fine, too.)
  6. Work.
  7. Analyze the session with a mini retro.
  8. Repeat.

- This cycle will happen at least every day and perhaps more often if the work doesn't go as expected, which it often doesn't.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment - Due Thursday, 10/27 at Noon
    ### Django Freeshelf Pair Version
    - Instructions to create the repo: 
      - Only one person on the team will clone the repository. When you decide who this is, they should click this [Assignment Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/SlpTu2Up) and clone as with previous homework. Other team members can click the link in order to access the README.
      - Other team members will get access to the repo by the owner sharing it using the VS Code extension [Liveshare](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share). Make sure everyone has the Liveshare extension installed and then the owner of the repo should follow the directions for starting a share session. Please confirm that everyone is able to type in the code using this tool before moving forward.

## ðŸ¤© End of Phase Presentation (individual) - due Friday, 10/28 at noon

Each person has 4-5 min to talk about one of the following topics using examples from your own code. **This should be code that you personally wrote**, at least most of it, giving credit to teammates where it's due. It is also ok if you wrote the code during a pairing/team session, as long as you note that in your presentation and you know what all the code does.

Please make a video as you did for Phase 1 using Loom or similar and submit the link to your video using this [form](https://forms.gle/KwTSPhnCw9rVdwxB9) by 12 noon on Friday, October 28.

### Topics: Pick one

For all topics, **the code should be from Django Music or Django Freeshelf**. If you have a different project that you want to present, or want to present on a topic not listed, please come talk to me to get approval.

1. Pick any url, view, and template that you worked on. Walk through what happens _in the code_ when that url is typed into the browser's address bar (or a link with that url is clicked). You should talk about:
      - the url in urls.py
      - the view
      - any models that are involved
      - any decisions you made about how to do this or how not to do it.
      - Would you do it differently next time?
2. Tell us about a form to create objects in your application (e.g., a form to create a new album in Django Music or resource in Django Freeshelf). How does this work? You should tell us about:
      - the form class in forms.py
      - the url
      - the view
      - the template
      - Anything challenging that you had to figure out about this?
3. Explain (at least one of) your models, talking through any attributes or relationships. Why did you build it this way? You could show us your database using DB Browser for SQLite, an ER Diagram that show relationships with other models, or creating or querying for model objects in the Django shell (or `shell_plus`).
4. Show a template that you worked on and explain how the code in the template works. You should tell us about:
      - the view that renders it and its view context
      - any conditional rendering in the template
      - content blocks
      - any other template tags you used and what they are doing
      - how this template is rendered in browser
5. Anything you implemented that you're jazzed about? Please tell us about it. You could touch on:
      - describe the feature from the user perspective. What does it do and why is it needed?
      - how does it work in the code?
      - did you use any libraries or packages?
      - was there anything tricky about this? what did you learn to be able to do this?

### Evaluation & starting the next phase

As with the end-of-phase of Phase 1, presentations are meant to assess what you've learned during the phase and to determine whether you are prepared to begin the next phase.

Your instructors will assess the work youâ€™ve done and determine whether you will go on to the next phase.

The criteria for passing a phase are:

- Your project is complete (it meets most, if not all, criteria in the original assignment).
- Your code runs without errors.
- You can explain how your code works. Instructors may ask you about any portion of it and you can give a reasonable explanation.

You might be asked to repeat the phase if:

- You are unfamiliar with how your code works.
- You have nothing to present.

If we have concerns about you starting the next phase, you will hear from us on Thursday afternoon, and I'll ask you to meet with us on Friday morning. **If you have any concerns about passing the phase you are welcome to reach out to me or Jessica before then.**
