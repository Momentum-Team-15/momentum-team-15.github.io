## 🤨 Perspective

![](/assets/img/dan-abramov-tweet.png){:.img--post}

You can't learn how to code by studying or memorizing. The only way to learn is to write code -- and you have to do that before you really understand it. By trying things, and running code, you learn what it does and how it works. Experience is built on practice.

We don't expect you to *know* how to do anything in Phase 3. We do expect you use all the resources at your disposal to *figure it out*.

For an insightful take on being comfortable with what you don't know, read this great blog post by one of the most well-respected and influential JavaScript developers out there right now: **[Dan Abramov, Things I Don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)**

## ✅ TODO for Everyone for the First Week


- Complete this [Goals Reflection exercise]({% link goals-reflection.md %}) to re-energize for what's ahead and focus on what you want to accomplish and **post a tip from your CONTINUE list, or a request for advice for something that you've been struggling with** to our team Slack channel.
  - Reflect on where you are in this program. You've learned a lot and you have a lot left to learn. What are YOUR goals?
- **Create a schedule** that you can stick to for the times you will not be in class (see the time management resources below for some suggestions on managing your time effectively).
- [Learn Markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) -> see the resources section below.
- Pick a note-taking application that will let you take notes while you read and work. It's important that it can properly format code blocks. Here are some options (don't overthink this choice -- just pick something that you feel comfortable with).
    - [VS Code](https://helgeklein.com/blog/2020/10/vs-code-as-markdown-note-taking-app/) (with this option you could create a simple git repo with markdown files)

    - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

### Markdown & Taking Notes

Markdown is an easy-to-learn way to add formatting to plain text and code snippets. It is commonly used in READMEs on GitHub and can even used to generate HTML. It comes in handy a lot for developers, and you should know how to use it.

The `.md` extension indicates a Markdown file. The pages for this site and every note in your team's `notes` repo are formatted in Markdown -- have a look on GitHub for examples!
