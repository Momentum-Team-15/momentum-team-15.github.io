## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- Checking in on project progress üëÄ
- Adding search in your application üîç

To implement search in your application, you will need to collect user input and then either make an API request or filter existing data on the page. It's often useful to have a text input so that your user can type in a search term, although you could use other types of inputs as well.

## üéØ Project due on Thursday afternoon

**Please include a README** in your project repo. The README should:

- be written in Markdown
- include a link to your production application
- have instructions for getting your application running locally, so that any developer could pull it down and run it.

üëâ If your project meets minimum requirements today, HUZZAH! That is awesome. You should be working on **at least one additional or spicy feature**.

üëâ If your project does not yet meet minimum requirements, your goal should be meeting them **by the end of the day Wednesday**.

### Note

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your UI has sensible options for your user. For example: A user who is not the creator of a card should not see buttons or links to edit a card. If a user is logged in, they should no longer see options to log in, but they should see an option to log out. The flow through your application should make sense according to what a user would reasonably expect.

### Minimum Requirements for QuestionBox, Front End

- Any user can see all questions
- A user can see all the answers posted for a specific question
- A user can post a question
- A user can post an answer to a question
- A user can mark an answer to their own question as "accepted"
- A user can see a list of all their own questions
- A user can see a list of all their own answers
- A user can star/favorite and unstar/unfavorite questions and/or answers

### Minimum Requirements for Social Cards, Front End

- A user can see all the cards from all users (or all the public/published cards if you have a way to do this)
- A user can see all the cards they themselves have created
- A user can see all the cards from a user they follow
- A user can design and create a new card
- A user can update (edit) a card they've created
- A user can delete a card they've created
- A user can follow another user
- A user can unfollow another user
- A user can see a list of users they follow

## Example Search Request with Query Params

Remember the [iTunes API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1)? You made a request to the API to get search results, and you needed to include query params that specified the search fields and terms you wanted to use for the search.

Here's how you might make a request that uses query params using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config). Note: this example depends on `searchTerm` and `token` being defined in your code.

```js
axios.get('https://drf-library-api.herokuapp.com/api/books',
  {
    params: {search: searchTerm},
    headers: {Authorization: `Token ${token}` }
  }
)
```

### Filtering existing data in your component

You could also perform a search without making an AJAX request, by filtering data that you already have in React. Here are a couple of examples of how you could do that.
