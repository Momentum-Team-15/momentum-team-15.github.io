## üìñ Pre-reading for Monday
- At least *one* article from this group about **Object Oriented Programming**:
  - [Real Python - Object-Oriented Programming in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
  - [A Byte of Python: OO](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
  - [Inheritance and Composition in Python OO](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)
  - [OO-Programming](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html) -- _This is a chapter from a book called **Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python** by Al Sweigart. He has written a ton of great books on Python and makes them available to read for free online at [inventwithpython.com](https://inventwithpython.com/). You might check out [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It's a fantastic beginner book._

- All of these articles about **Classes**:
  - [Python Docs: Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
  - [StackOverflow: How do I design a class in Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4203163/how-do-i-design-a-class-in-python/4203836#4203836)
  - [Special Methods (aka magic methods) in the Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)
  - [A Guide to Python's Magic Methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/) _This is a great reference, but watch out! It was written for Python 2, so a few things may be different in Python 3._


### üêûUseful resources for debugging
- [Scope of Variables in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scope-of-variables-python)
- [üêõ Debugging Python For Fun & Profit (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMCZgYfEJJI)
- [Code Style Checks in Python](https://julien.danjou.info/code-style-checks-in-python/) _We installed `flake8` on the first day of this phase. This post gives you some detail about what it's for and why you need it._
