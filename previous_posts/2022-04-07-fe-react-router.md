## 🎯 Project

Continue planning with your team on tackling the Questionbox or Social Ecards projects. By Friday, you should be able to make requests for questions and answers if you are working on Questionbox or make requests for getting or creating cards. Deploy to Netlify as soon as possible (Tip 💡: Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it!).

## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

⚠️ These two resources are for **older versions of React Router**, so you will see some **outdated syntax**. For instance `Switch`, `Redirect`, and the `component` prop on `Route` exist only in versions of React Router earlier than version 6. However, the main concepts are the same, so these resources can still help you understand the context and usage of React Router.
