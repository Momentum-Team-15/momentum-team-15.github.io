## üéØ Collaborative Project

This week you will begin work on a project with both front- and back-end teammates. This project is due next week at the end of the Phase.

The front-end will build a React application that will make AJAX requests to the back-end application built with Django and Django REST Framework. There are no strict rules about who works on front-end or back-end, so your team can decide how best to use your resources.

Your team can choose between two projects. They will _both_ give you practice doing what you have been doing (building an API or building a React application based around CRUD functionality) but they present some different problems to solve. Choose the one that sounds more fun to you.

### Options

#### Social ECards

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--social-cards/blob/main/README.md)
- [Social ECards assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/8-TeFuMx)

#### QuestionBox

- [Project description](https://github.com/momentum-projects/group--questionbox/blob/main/README.md)
- [QuestionBox assignment invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/FQSkPOkP)

Whichever one you choose, your whole team is building the same one.

#### How to handle GitHub

The backend creates its own repo and the front end create its own repo, so for the same project you have _two_ repos. If you are the only dev in your repo, you may choose not to use pull requests, although you can, and it is still a good idea to use branches. If you have two backend devs on your team, you _must_ use pull requests.

**When you start work in this repo, you should delete the README at the root.** (You can save it somewhere else -- it's just a Markdown file). Then when you start your Django or React app, you should **install it at the root of the repo directory, not in a subdirectory** (you do this by specifying the current directory with a `.` instead of a project name). This will make deploying easier.



### The Teams

1. **Team StarLord**: K.E., Alex, Jocelyn
2. **Team Gamora**: Kalen, Ted
3. **Team Rocket**: Adam, Ryan
4. **Team Groot**: Brittany, Emily
5. **Team Drax**: Paul, Osama, Tyler

#### How to work as one team

Even though you have two separate applications, you're working together to ship a single product on time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately.

We'll talk about the projects in class tomorrow. Remember to **read the README very carefully**. Your goals tonight:

- Choose a project.
- Understand the project requirements thoroughly and discuss what you need to build.
- Outline a plan for what you'll need to do. This can be a text outline, sketches of user flow, basic wireframes.
- **WRITE YOUR PLANS DOWN.** You can use Trello / Google Docs / Excalidraw / Miro... whatever. Make sure everyone on your team has access to this documentation.
- You are encouraged to work with other front or back end devs on other teams to share ideas, solutions, and resources.
- Come to class meetings prepared to give progress reports and ask for help on what you're working on.

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next.
