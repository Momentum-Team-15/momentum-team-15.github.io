---

The past few months have prepared you to take on the challenge ahead in these next four weeks. You may not _feel_ ready, but you ARE.

Your goal in this phase is to design and build a real-world software product, working collaboratively on a small team using agile development practices and all the tools you've already learned, and some you will learn as you go.

At the end of the phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and the Momentum community.

The experience of working on a team during this phase and the product you build will form the foundation for your job search. _The people skills you'll use will be just as important as the technical skills!_

**You will not begin writing code for your project until all the planning is done.** It's possible your team will be ready to write code by Friday of this week.

## Today's topics

- What is agile development?
- Forming final project groups
- Brainstorming product ideas

## ‚úÖ TODO once you have team assignments

- Create a Slack channel (not a thread) and add team members and instructors to it.
- Create a team agreement with your team and post it in your team's Slack channel (please pin or bookmark it).
- Brainstorm ideas for your final project and be ready to pitch one or two ideas tomorrow morning.
