## 🗓️ Today's topics

- Requesting an auth token for login

## 🎯 Project

Work with your team to get the initial components in place for Questionbox or Social E-cards projects.

### By Friday

- be able to make GET requests for questions and answers / cards and friends
- show them on the page
- have a solid start on POST requests
- deploy to Netlify as soon as possible (TIP ⭐ Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it!)

    - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
