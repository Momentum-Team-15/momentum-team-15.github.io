## 🗓️ Today's Topics

How are the projects coming along? 👀

Keep pushing forward! 💪 🚀

Today's class is devoted to getting you past any blockers you may be experiencing and to talk through next steps.

Minimum requirements are listed below for reference.

## 🎯 Project due on Thursday afternoon

**Please include a README** in your project repo. The README should be written in markdown, include a link to your production application, and have instructions for getting your application running locally, so that any developer could pull it down and run it. If your setup makes any assumptions about the environment (e.g., [you have Node.js 14.0 or higher](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#creating-an-app) installed locally), please state them in the README.

👉 If your project meets minimum requirements today, HUZZAH! That is awesome. You should be working on **at least one additional or spicy feature**.

👉 If your project does not yet meet minimum requirements, you should aim for meeting them **by the end of the day tomorrow**.

_Note: The bullet points listed under requirements do not necessarily correspond to pages/screens. You can achieve these requirements using any design you like._
