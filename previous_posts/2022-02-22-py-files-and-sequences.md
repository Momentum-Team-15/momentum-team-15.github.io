title: Python Sequences and Files
tags: phase-2 python sequences lists tuples files
---

We can use the generic term _sequence_ for any object that provides an ordered structure for a number of items, such as a string (a group of characters), a list, or a dictionary (keys and values).

Files are important as inputs for our programs. Today we'll learn about working with text files.

## üìÖ Today's Topics

- Lists and tuples
- More Strings
- Dictionaries
- Working with files

### üêç Code Break
