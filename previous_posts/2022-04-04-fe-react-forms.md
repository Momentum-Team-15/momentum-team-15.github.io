### Working with Local Storage in React

- [use-local-storage-state](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) -> You would `npm install use-local-storage-state` to use it in your code
    - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
