### File uploads

- [Django Docs: FileField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#filefield)
- [Pillow: Python Imaging Library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - [`django-imagekit`](https://django-imagekit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -> If you want to resize images when they are uploaded, or do any kind of image processing, you will need this. Don't add it unless you know you need it.

#### A request with a file attachment using Insomnia

- Select the right HTTP method for your endpoint.
- Choose binary file attachment from the JSON menu (where you normally put the body of a request)
- Set headers on the Headers tab (this example assumes an image file in jpeg format, named `profile-photo.jpg`):

  ```txt
  Content-Type: image/jpeg
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=profile-photo.jpg
  ```

For more information on the values for `Content-Type`:

- [MDN Content-Type Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type)
- [MDN MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)

#### CORS for file upload

Assuming you are using `django-cors-headers`, you'll need to add the following to `settings.py`:

```py
# in settings.py

from corsheaders.defaults import default_headers

CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS = list(default_headers) + [
    'content-disposition',
]
```
