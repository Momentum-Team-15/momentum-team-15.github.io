## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- FreeShelf retrospective
- Collaboration in a shared repo

## üéØ Project: Django Team Project

Today we'll begin our first real team project, with a shared repo. This will require more planning, a lot of communication and coordination, and adding on some new Git skills that will let us collaborate effectively.

You will work in a shared repo and **submit one application** that your team will build together. You need to discuss who will do what, but keep in mind that the work needs to be **shared as equally as possible**.

You have two options to choose from for this assignment. Your team should meet to discuss and **decide today** which one you will do.

Then, the very next thing you should do is determine what **models** you will need and what attributes and relationships they should have. An ER diagram can be very helpful here.

This assignment is due next Thursday at the end of the Phase.

### Dev Teams

For this project, **the first team member listed should accept the assignment** and enter the name of your team.

After that step, the other team members can then accept the assignment and join their team.

- ‚ö° **Team ThunderClan**: Alex, K.E., Ryan
- üèû **Team RiverClan**: Tyler, Joey, Adam
- üå¨Ô∏è **Team WindClan**: Kalen, Emily
- üï∂ **Team ShadowClan**:  Paul, Jocelyn
- üå† **Team SkyClan**: Brittany, Osama, Ted

If you want to know where these names came from, [have I got a website for you](https://warriorcats.com/clans-cats/clans).

### ‚úÖ Project Checklist

- Set up a new Django project from scratch. There is no starter code in the assignment repo.
- Make sure to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files (like your `.env` file and `db.sqlite3`) from Git. You can get one specific to a Django project at [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). Just search for `Django` and copy and paste the text you find there into your `.gitignore` file. It should be placed at the root of your repo.
- Make sure to create a custom user model, following best practices. **Do this before you run any migrations.** [This guide may be helpful to you.](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
- You may want to install `django-debug-toolbar`, `django-extensions`, and `django-environ`, as we have done in previous projects.
