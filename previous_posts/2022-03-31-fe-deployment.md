## 🎯 Project

The React Trivia application is due on Monday -- that means it meets at least the **minimum functional requirements** and is **deployed to Netlify** 🚀.

**Minimum functional requirements:**

- A user can see a list of categories.
- A user can select one category.
- A user can see a list of questions for that category, with answer options for each question.
- A user can select an answer for a question.
- A user can see if that answer is the correct answer.

**It would be awesome if:**

- The answers are shuffled so that the correct answer is not always in the same position.
- A user can see how many questions they answered correctly (or some kind of score) when they have answered all the questions in a category.
