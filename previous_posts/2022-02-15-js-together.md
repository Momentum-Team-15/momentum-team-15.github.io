This week we will review, reinforce, and test our understanding and assumptions about JavaScript. We'll do some live coding in class together. We'll also practice reading errors, debugging, and getting back on track when it feels like you're not making progress.

## In-class Project: Team Programming Exercise

We're going to code live together in class using a practice called _mob programming_. This is like pair programming, with more than two people but still only one computer. We will create an application as a group, and everyone will participate in figuring out how to implement features and writing the code.

[Details about the exercise are here, along with your team assignments]({% link team-programming.md %}).

## ðŸŽ¯ Week-long Project

Keep on working on your Notes App. It's due on Thursday afternoon.
