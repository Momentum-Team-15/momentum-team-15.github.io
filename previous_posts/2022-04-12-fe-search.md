## Example Request to Upload a File

This is an update (notice the PUT verb) to an existing record. In this case you are including the file itself as the body of the request (notice it in the second position as an argument to `put()`) and setting specific headers required by the server to handle the binary file attachment.

```js
axios.put(url, file, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Token ' + token,
    'Content-Type': file.type,
    'Content-Disposition': `attachment; filename=${file.name}`
  }
}).then(res => console.log(res.data))
```

NOTE: If you Google how to include a file attachment in an ajax request, you'll see a lot of references to using the FormData object. You _can_ do it that way, but you don't have to; the above method will work just fine as long as you know how to access the file that is being uploaded by the user.

Here's info about [using FormData objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects) if you want to know more about that.

See the resources below for more information about using a file input element and accessing a selected file. The `useRef()` hook will be helpful to get the files from the input element.
