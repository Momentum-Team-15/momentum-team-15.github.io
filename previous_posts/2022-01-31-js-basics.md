### ✅ TODO Today

1. Watch [Working Smarter: 5 Steps to Getting Unstuck with Rukia Sheikh-Mohamed](https://dev.to/rukiaasm/working-smarter-5-steps-to-getting-unstuck-with-rukia-sheikh-mohamed-1932)
2. Review the [notes from class](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-11/notes/blob/main/intro-js.md). ⭐ PRO TIP: type out the examples in the notes -- not from memory! -- and run the code yourself to see what it does. Make some changes and see what happens! 💫
3. Check out [this practice exercise](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-11/exercise--js-hello-world) if you want a warm-up. Clone the repo to work on it locally. You do _not_ need to push commits or turn this in.
4. Lab project: JavaScript Problem Set 1, due tomorrow.
